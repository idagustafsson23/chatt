__Chatt__

Somewhat secure group chat with encrypted PMs

_Code Sample_

_Getting Started_
Before joining the chatroom you need to register an account. this is done by navigating to [this should not be the link] localhost:8080/chatt/create-user.xhtml
Fill in desired username and password, marvel at the complete lack of responsiveness
For extra security a user can choose to register account with a Yubikey(www.yubico.com) - this step is optional

A yubikey provides extra account security by forcing a second verification.
The key generates a randomized one-time password. The application controls that it is the same key that was used for creating the account and 
yubico controlls that the key is valid and has not been used before.

if(userFromDB.getKeyId() != null && YubicoClient.isValidOTPFormat(generatedKey)){	//check if the key has the right format
	response = Yubico.getClient().verify(generatedKey);				//check if key is valid/not used				
	if (response.isOk()) {
		String yubikeyId = YubicoClient.getPublicId(GeneratedKey);			
		if (userFromDB.getKeyId().equals(yubikeyId)) {				//Check if same key as used for registration
			//Login
		}
	}
}

if registration is sucessfull, you will be redirected to the login page (localhost:8080/chatt/login.xhtml)
Enter your account credentials and press enter (or click login)

Type your message in the first text box and press send(or enter) to send a message to all connected users

to send a encrypted private message add the recipients username in the second text box (labeled "To:"). As before click send or press enter to send
the encrypted message will be displayed for all users but only the inteded recipient will see the decrypted message
